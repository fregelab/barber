== IO

There's no point on having functions to modify an image if you can't
read or write them right ? You can find functions to retrieve and
write images in `barber.Barber` module:

NOTE: IO functions will probably be re-design on next
versions. Specially to follow a common error handling design.

=== Read

In order to get a `BufferedImage` this function needs the path of the
file containing the image. It may return either an `IOException` or
the image itself.

include::{srcCode}/barber/Barber.fr[tags=read]

=== Write

In order to write a `BufferedImage` this function needs the path of
the destination file. It may return either an `IOException` or
a positive `Boolean` value (True)..
