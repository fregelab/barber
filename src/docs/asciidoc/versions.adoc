== Versions

This is the compatibility version table of the current Barber release:

.Compatibility table
|===

|name|version

|barber
|{barber-version}

|frege-core
|{frege-version}

|frege-repl
|{frege-repl}

|jdk
|{target-jdk}+
|===

IMPORTANT: Because Frege is evolving at fast pace, at least at the
moment, Barber is trying to follow latest versions of Frege. That's
why I thought it would be important to have a chapter where users
would see a compatibility table of the current release.
